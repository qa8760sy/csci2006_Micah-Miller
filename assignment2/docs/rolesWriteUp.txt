Users-
Currently there are only two types of users.
The Guest-which has access to the cart, and to view any of the none account specific pages.
The account user-Someone who access to all forward facing pages and has thier own account page with relevant pages.

I've added code that will produce an error when someone with a guest login tries to access an account page or wishlist page. Theres only
two pages that they shouldn't be able to access so I just threw in a check to see if the currentUser session variable wasn't guest.
And because database information requires other database information I don't believe theres a guest or for one user to get another users
private info. 

I theorize adding a new roles to shouldn't be terrible difficult. Without creating a new table. I would a new column to the customer 
database something like "access level". maybe changing the customer table to "user" table or something of that nature. Right now the site
only has pages for people to purchase artwork. But it could be expanded to include options for website admins. Changing the nav bar 
at the top to include pages to manage accounts with actions like: check order status, issue refunds..Uh, other stuff? I think its pretty
obvious I don't have much an idea what would be practical or not. Somethign I've always felt with computers in general is that they can
do anything. SO if theres a role that needs to be created the privlages can assigned to a user/admin staff that can do it. 

I'm having trouble pushing this to git so this is a "change" hopefully it will register.
