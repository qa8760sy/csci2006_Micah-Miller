Users-
Currently there are only two types of users.
The Guest-which has access to the cart, and to view any of the none account specific pages.
The account user-Someone who access to all forward facing pages and has thier own account page with relevant pages.

I've added code that will produce an error when someone with a guest login tries to access an account page or wishlist page.
And because database information requires other database information I don't believe theres a guest or for one user to get another users
private info.

I theorize adding a new roles to shouldn't be terrible difficult. Without creating a new table. I would a new column to the customer 
database something like "access level".
