You've been teaching me for a few semesters by this time. So, I don't feel I need to sugar coat my aspiriations. I don't know what the future holds for me or if I'm going to really puruse a career in the computer science/programming world. But if I do I feel having a little of experience in a lot of places is good. My main goal is just to find a way to be happy, really. Financially supporting myself via programming seems like something I might be capapble of doing. I do enjoy some aspects, for instance when I'm comfortable with a program and paradigms I'm using that's attached to it I kind of enjoy bug hunting. When i started the computer classes, which was actually your intro class (I forget the class name) with c++ I was genuinely enthuased to go home after each of those 4hr night classes and start on my assignments. I've never thought of computers as a science in itself until I started taking classes and I realized just how deep of a hole this science be and I'm often finding myself struggling to maintain interest let alone enthusiasm in what feels like the mundane. If I had to do it day in and day out I don't know if that joy would hold. 

The knowlede of server-side programming in the future just rounds out my client side knowledge. And to be blunt, I needed the credits to keep the loan from going into repayment.
