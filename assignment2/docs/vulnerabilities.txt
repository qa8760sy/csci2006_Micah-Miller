The scafolding to validate input via phptaken from a previous lab assignment is in place I've only failed to implement
it at this time. It would require a larger amount of re-writting than i was ready for and bit of a bit more than i 
could chew with the time remaining. The only thing currently in place is the simple html "required" attribute to keep 
fields from being empty and a range check on the number fields.

One thing I do notice is 90% of the forms data is simply text fields with a huge amount of variation that can be entered
into those fields, they're mostly things like names and addresses. The regex for these would be failry simply and straight
forward. Moslty not allowing negative values to gum up the works. or allowing numbers in states, though this is assuming
we can only be accessed by countries that are in the US or at least a country that does not use simple numbers are its state
equivalence. To be frank I'm meerely going for partial points on this assignemnt since i am as mentioned before simply out
of time. And to some degree a little burnt out I've put probably a full 30 or so hours into programming as a whole in the last
few days.
